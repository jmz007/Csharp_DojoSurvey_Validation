                 C# Dojo Survey with Validations

 Objectives
        Practice refactoring code
        Continued practice with model validations

Let's update the Dojo Survey assignment one more time, this time adding the appropriate validations.

Note: At this point, we still don't have a way to persist the submitted data for longer than one request, so go ahead and render the Result page if successful, just this one last time.
